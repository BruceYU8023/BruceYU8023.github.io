She gained a lot of experience in comprehensive analysis of large-scale cancer sequencing projects during her work at MGI. Her current graduate research primarily focuses on developing sequence analysis methods for the design of cancer vaccines and personalized immunotherapy regimens. She has been heavily involved in helping design cancer vaccines for a number of clinical trials at Washington University School of Medicine, and has led the team to develop pVACtools/pVACseq â€“ a cancer immunogenomics pipeline for selection and visualization of neoantigens. She is also interested in applying machine learning methods to better predict patient response during immunotherapy trials.</p>

Her ongoing interests concern the enablement of precision medicine through the identification of clinically relevant variants that aid in better prognosis and diagnosis of cancer syndromes and the development of web resources to aid in the interpretation and discovery of such clinically relevant variants. Currently Kaitlin curates information relating to von-Hippel Lindau disease (VHLD), a neoplastic syndrome resulting from the inactivation of the VHL tumor suppressor gene. Her project aides to the overall goal of the CIViC project by developing a comprehensive web source of VHL variants. In the future Kaitlin hopes to pursue an MD/PhD in integrative genomics.</p>

In one project, he focused on studying genomic features associated with response to trastuzumab in HER2-positive breast cancer. In a series of other projects, he worked to identify highly validated regulatory sites within the human genome to update the ORegAnno database and design a novel regulome capture reagent. He initiated ongoing studies with this reagent in conjunction with targeted sequencing of TCGA breast cancer samples to identify recurrent alterations in the regulatory regions of the disease.
