I"Q<p>CIViCpy (<a href="http://civicpy.org">civicpy.org</a>), a Software Development Kit (SDK) and analysis toolkit, enables high-throughput queries on variant interpretation data from the CIViC knowledgebase. Led by co-first authors Alex Wagner and Susanna Kiwala, CIViCpy has already been utilized by the CIViC team for use in the <a href="https://github.com/griffithlab/civic2clinvar">civic2clinvar</a> utility and for VCF exports of CIViC content. The associated manuscript was <a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/pdf/10.1200/CCI.19.00127">published online today</a> in a special issue on <em>Informatics Tools for Cancer Research and Care</em> in JCO Clinical Cancer Informatics. This CIViCpy publication highlights the evaluation of &gt;1,200 variants per second using the built-in pre-cache and search routines on the real-world AACR Project GENIE dataset. CIViCpy is <a href="https://github.com/griffithlab/civicpy">open-source on GitHub</a> and permissively (MIT) licensed.</p>
