I"´<p>The 2018 fantasy football season has ended, and Malachi Griffith has led the <em>Thundering Typhoons</em> to become
the lab champions until the close of next season. The toilet bowl trophy goes to our last-place 
team, <em>No Tengo Idea</em>, managed by Kilannin Krysiak. An honorary mention goes to rookie manager Thomas Mooney, who led
the <em>Evansville Crimson Giants</em> to second place in our traditional lab competition.</p>
