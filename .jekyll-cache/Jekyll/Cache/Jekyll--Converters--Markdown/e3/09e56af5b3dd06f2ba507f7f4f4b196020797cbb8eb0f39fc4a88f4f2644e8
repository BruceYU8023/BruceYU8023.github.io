Her work focuses on the analysis and interpretation of genomic and transcriptomic sequence data produced from a variety of cancer types. Her primary interest is in the use of genomic data to improve the current standards of patient care. Since joining the McDonnell Genome Institute in 2014 she has been involved in comprehensive analysis of cancer patient cohorts as well as small and n-of-1 studies. In collaboration with the Genomics Tumor Board, she has led the analysis of case studies in order to better understand the molecular underpinnings of multiple hematologic cancers.

She joined the Griffith Lab as a curator for the Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer (<a href="www.civicdb.org">CIViC</a>) project last year. Her ongoing interests concern the enablement of precision medicine through the identification of clinically relevant variants that aid in better prognosis and diagnosis of cancer syndromes and the development of web resources to aid in the interpretation and discovery of such clinically relevant variants. Currently Kaitlin curates information relating to von-Hippel Lindau disease (VHLD), a neoplastic syndrome resulting from the inactivation of the VHL tumor suppressor gene. Her project aides to the overall goal of the CIViC project by developing a comprehensive web source of VHL variants. In the future Kaitlin hopes to pursue an MD/PhD in integrative genomics.</p>
