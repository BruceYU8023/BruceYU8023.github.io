I"â<p>We report the comprehensive sequencing of 16 matched oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) tumors and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) to define the genomic fidelity of these models. We found that, at the individual level, PDX models conserve about 90% of the mutations detected in tumors from which they were derived and exhibit cell-intrinsic patterns highly concordant with their matched tumors. At the cohort level, we report the generation of PDXs representing the heterogeneous intratumor genomic and expression landscapes of the disease. We conclude that PDX models recapitulate their matched tumors and serve as an appropriate translational platform for OCSCC.</p>
